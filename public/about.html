<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm Samantha Wayne D. Gonzales, currently navigating my way through the second year of college. 
Beyond the textbooks, I'm all about exploring different interests and pushing my boundaries. Whether 
it's delving into intriguing subjects like web development—where I'm aiming to become a full-stack web developer 
and delve into web design—or diving headfirst into extracurricular activities, I'm all in. I've learned so much 
about myself through these experiences - how to lead, collaborate, and keep pushing even when the going gets tough. 
Excited for what the future holds and the chance to connect with others on this wild journey!</p>
